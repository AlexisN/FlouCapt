FlouCapt
========

"Our team develop a web application which provides a picture from a camera. A blur is applied on face to protect privacy. Pictures are take every 10 seconds by default.

The final objective is to obtain a virtual window to the place which is filmed with the camera on different screens. It has to work on different screen size. Floucapt has to be compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac and available on mobile phone with different browser like Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari & Internet explorer."
